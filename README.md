# Hey, I'm Twisted-Supernova🤙

🏗️ IT Engineer by day, gremlin by night.

I spend most of my time convincing people that the cloud is, in fact, not just someone else's computer and pastimeS include migrating anything that isn't nailed down to the cloud.

## 🧰 Toolbox

| Area | Tech |
|------|------|
| ☁️ **Cloud & Identity** | Azure, Microsoft 365, Entra ID, Exchange Online
| 🖥️ **Infrastructure** | VMware, Active Directory, Networking, Storage SAN |
| ⚡ **Automation & IaC** | PowerShell, Azure Bicep, Java, Visal Studo Code, Git
| 🎫 **ITSM & Ops** | ServiceNow, Commvault Backup & Recovery, Veeam
| 🛠️ **Scripting & Data** | PowerShell, Azure Shell

## 📂 What You'll Find Here

🔧 **PowerShell Scripts & Modules** — M365 admin tooling, Exchange Online management, API wrangling, and general Azure mischief
📐 **Azure Bicep Templates** — Infrastructure-as-Code because clicking through the portal 47 times is not a deployment strategy
🔄 **Automation Workflows** — Certificate lifecycle management, backup reporting, and operational runbooks that save future-me from past-me's problems

## 🎯 Currently Keeping Me Busy

- ☁️ Azure cloud migration — herding VMs northward
- 🔐 Certificate management automation — because nothing says "Monday morning" like an expired cert
- 💾 Commvault backup optimisation & reporting
- 🆔 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
